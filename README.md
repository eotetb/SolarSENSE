# SolarSENSE
This project aims to help farmers by providing the necessary information that will enable them to adapt their farming behaviors to the changing climactic conditions, finding the right balance between high yields and low environmental impact. More specifically, this will be done by providing farmers with valuable data from soil sensors to boost their yields while accurately identifying correct levels
of fertilizers and water needs.

Existing commercial soil sensors were developed for large agricultural concerns (for “big ag”) and require internet connectivity, cloud-based solutions,and on going subscription fees (at rates of thousands of dollars per month). Rural small-scale farms are challenged with lack of networks, electric power, and the extremely high cost of these commercial solutions.
